# üè° Home Office Network Asset Inventory

This project demonstrates a fundamental cybersecurity skill: identifying, classifying, and evaluating assets on a home office network. As part of an asset management exercise, I created an inventory of devices connected to a small business home network, assessed their characteristics, and assigned a sensitivity classification to each.

## üìã Project Overview

In this activity, I took on the role of a small business owner managing a home network. The goal was to:

- Identify devices connected to the home office network.
- Record their network usage, ownership, and physical location.
- Evaluate risk factors and sensitivity levels for each asset.

This activity reflects real-world practices in asset management, a critical part of any organization‚Äôs security strategy.

## üß† Skills Demonstrated

- Asset inventory creation  
- Risk evaluation and device classification  
- Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) considerations  
- Security documentation and organization

## üñ•Ô∏è Devices Included

| Asset                 | Network Access           | Owner          | Location              | Sensitivity     |
|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Smartphone (Owner's) | Always via Wi-Fi         | Jordan Butler  | Home office desk       | Confidential     |
| Smart TV             | Occasionally via Wi-Fi   | Household      | Living room            | Low              |
| External Hard Drive  | USB or Wi-Fi (occasional)| Jordan Butler  | Locked drawer (office) | Confidential     |

Each asset was assessed for its connectivity, data exposure, physical and logical access, and its potential impact if compromised.

## üõ°Ô∏è Why This Matters

Asset management is essential for identifying vulnerable endpoints, enforcing access control, and prioritizing cybersecurity defenses. Understanding and documenting assets in any environment ‚Äî including home networks ‚Äî is a foundational practice for roles in Security Operations Centers (SOC), risk management, and IT auditing.

## üìÅ Files

- `home_asset_inventory.xlsx` ‚Äì Completed asset inventory spreadsheet
- `README.md` ‚Äì Overview and explanation of the project

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

- Expand inventory to include IoT and cloud-connected devices  
- Integrate with vulnerability scanning tools for deeper insights  
- Use this documentation as part of a cybersecurity professional portfolio
